Here’s a comprehensive **Java Jakarta EE code review checklist** that can guide you through reviewing your code for quality, performance, maintainability, and best practices.

### **1. General Best Practices**
- **Code Formatting & Readability**
  - Consistent indentation and spacing.
  - Descriptive method and variable names.
  - Follow your project's or team’s code style guide.
  - Avoid large methods; split into smaller, manageable functions.

- **Error Handling**
  - Use `try-catch-finally` or `try-with-resources` appropriately.
  - Ensure exceptions are logged or handled correctly.
  - Avoid swallowing exceptions (i.e., empty catch blocks).
  - Throw appropriate custom exceptions if needed.

- **Logging**
  - Log meaningful information (errors, important actions).
  - Use a consistent logging strategy (e.g., `java.util.logging`, Log4J, SLF4J).
  - Ensure sensitive data is not logged (passwords, security tokens).
  
- **Security**
  - Validate all input data (especially if it's coming from external sources).
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
  - Avoid hardcoded sensitive information (credentials, API keys).
  - Properly manage session and authentication tokens.

### **2. Jakarta EE Specific**
- **CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)**
  - Ensure the correct use of CDI annotations (`@Inject`, `@Named`, etc.).
  - Check if the application uses dependency injection over manual object creation.
  - Verify the proper use of scopes (`@RequestScoped`, `@ApplicationScoped`, etc.).
  
- **EJB (Enterprise Java Beans)**
  - Ensure proper transactional management using `@Transactional` or `@TransactionManagement`.
  - Use `@Stateless` or `@Stateful` appropriately.
  - Ensure thread-safety in your EJBs.

- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**
  - Ensure proper entity mapping using JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, etc.).
  - Avoid n+1 select issues by using `JOIN FETCH` or `EntityGraphs`.
  - Ensure queries are efficient, with proper indexing on the database side.
  - Use `EntityManager` properly (beginning/committing transactions correctly).
  - Consider lazy vs. eager loading and ensure the appropriate fetching strategy.

- **RESTful Services (JAX-RS)**
  - Ensure proper use of annotations (`@GET`, `@POST`, `@Path`, `@Produces`, etc.).
  - Validate request parameters and payloads (input validation, size limits).
  - Ensure appropriate HTTP status codes are returned (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for bad request, 404 for not found, etc.).
  - Secure endpoints using `@RolesAllowed` or `@PermitAll` where necessary.
  
- **Servlets & Filters**
  - Ensure servlets are lightweight and handle requests efficiently.
  - Use filters for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, etc.
  - Avoid logic-heavy servlets; delegate business logic to other components.

### **3. Performance & Scalability**
- **Database Access**
  - Avoid unnecessary database calls (use caching where appropriate).
  - Use connection pooling effectively.
  - Ensure that the number of database transactions is minimized.

- **Asynchronous Processing**
  - For background jobs, use `@Asynchronous` or consider JMS or external job schedulers.
  
- **Caching**
  - Ensure you use caching for expensive and frequently accessed operations (e.g., database results, heavy computations).
  - Use appropriate caching strategies (e.g., in-memory cache, distributed cache).

- **Resource Management**
  - Ensure that resources such as database connections, file handlers, and network sockets are properly closed (use try-with-resources).
  - Ensure HTTP sessions are not unnecessarily long-lived.
  
### **4. Testing & Coverage**
- **Unit Testing**
  - Ensure that critical business logic is covered by unit tests.
  - Use mocking frameworks (e.g., Mockito) where dependencies make unit testing difficult.
  
- **Integration Testing**
  - Use proper integration tests for database interactions, JPA, and REST endpoints.
  - Test with embedded containers for Servlet or REST endpoint validation (e.g., using Arquillian, Testcontainers).

- **Code Coverage**
  - Ensure adequate code coverage for both unit and integration tests.
  - Focus on branch coverage, not just line coverage.

### **5. Security Considerations**
- **Input Validation**
  - Validate all user inputs for size, format, and type.
  - Use bean validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.) for enforcing validation rules.

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Ensure proper authentication mechanisms are in place (JWT, OAuth, etc.).
  - Ensure proper role-based access control using `@RolesAllowed`.

- **Data Encryption**
  - Secure sensitive data in transit (use HTTPS for all endpoints).
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest.

### **6. Database Layer**
- **ORM Optimization**
  - Ensure correct use of caching (first-level and second-level).
  - Minimize database calls and avoid unnecessary select statements.
  - Use `batch` operations for large datasets instead of iterating over individual insert/update queries.

- **SQL Queries**
  - Avoid hard-coded SQL in your Java code (use named queries, entity queries, or a query builder like Criteria API).
  - Test queries for performance (ensure indices are used where needed).

### **7. Dependency Management**
- **Maven/Gradle Dependencies**
  - Ensure you are not including unnecessary dependencies.
  - Avoid multiple versions of the same library.
  - Ensure your dependencies are up to date (especially regarding security vulnerabilities).

- **Versioning**
  - Stick to known and compatible versions of Jakarta EE APIs.
  - Document which versions of external dependencies are used.

### **8. Code Maintainability**
- **SOLID Principles**
  - Check for adherence to SOLID principles (e.g., Single Responsibility, Open/Closed).
  - Ensure proper separation of concerns in your classes.

- **Code Duplication**
  - Minimize code duplication by refactoring common logic into utility classes or services.
  
- **Documentation**
  - Ensure the code is well-documented with Javadoc.
  - Write clear comments explaining complex logic.

### **9. Build and Deployment**
- **Configuration Management**
  - Use externalized configuration (use `.properties` files, environment variables, etc.).
  - Avoid hardcoded values, especially sensitive ones.

- **CI/CD Integration**
  - Ensure that the code is integrated into a CI/CD pipeline (for continuous integration and automated testing).

### **10. UI and REST API Versioning**
- **Backward Compatibility**
  - Ensure that REST API versioning is in place (e.g., `/api/v1`).
  - If using a UI, make sure changes don’t break existing functionality.

Following this checklist will help ensure that your Jakarta EE application follows best practices, is maintainable, performs well, and remains secure.
